**Describe the bug**
The issue title is the first thing a developer sees when approaching your issue. Please provide a clear and concise description of what the bug is, without too much detail. Your bug report should always describe the behavior that you believe is unexpected. For example: "Duplication occurs during drag & drop" could be a great bug title if such an issue was occurred.

**Provide a Minimal, Reproducible Example**
Please provide a small, self-contained code snippet that demonstrates the bug. You can use a tool like [DartPad](https://dartpad.dev/) or link to a GitHub repository. This is the most important step to help us fix the issue quickly.

```dart
// Your minimal, reproducible code sample here
```

**Steps to reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
- Given a setup that has the timeline scrubber initialized with some data
- When I scrub the timeline to a specific point
- Then:
  - Expected behavior:
    - A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen
  - Observed behavior:
    - A clear and concise description of what behavior you observed

***NOTE***
Always refer to the bugged behavior as "observed," never "actual." As a point of historical record, this actually becomes false immediately upon resolution, while "observations" remain relevant forever.

**Screenshots or Videos**
If applicable, add screenshots or videos to help explain your problem. Videos are highly encouraged for interaction-based bugs.
